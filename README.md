## ðŸ“¥ Setting up [`thumbsup`](https://thumbsup.github.io/docs/)

1. Install `thumbsup` witn npm, globally.

```
npm install -g thumbsup
```

2. Download [GraphicsMagick (Installer)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/graphicsmagick/files/graphicsmagick-binaries/) and install it.

3. Download [exiftool (Windows Executable)](https://exiftool.org/), extract it and copy it to a folder.

4. Add both of these folders to **System PATH** (GraphicsMagick installation folder and the folder which has our `exiftool.exe`)

## ðŸ“š Adding new images

- Copy your high quality images into `./original_photos`

  - You may compress it with [File Converter](https://github.com/Tichau/FileConverter)
  - All images should be in `.jpg`

## ðŸ›  Update the images

- Run the command below

```bash
thumbsup --input ./original_photos --output ./gallery
```

![](https://github.com/thumbsup/thumbsup/raw/master/docs/demo.gif)

- The new compressed images and the other thumbsup files will be generated inside `./gallery`

- Rename `./gallery/index.html` to `./gallery/quick.html`

- Move and replace everything from `./gallery` to `./`
